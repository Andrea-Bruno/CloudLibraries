# CloudLibraries
Library for the creation of symmetric cloud (with server and equal client), with double communication protocol based on encrypted API (proprietary implementation of addition of encryption to API rest) and encrypted socket communication protocol with digital signature of packets (see the project EncryptedMesseging which is the basis of this project and adds a level of trustless protection for what concerns accounts, using the technology derived from BitCoin, in which there are no accounts or a backend but each account is a pair of cryptographic keys, and the private one must never leave the font end and or be concise).
This library allows for the creation of multiple instances, allowing you to add great scalability to your business infrastructure, allowing you to mount new clouds or sub-clouds on the fly with tree schemas.
