# CloudSync
## Client server cloud sync library
The Cloud Sync library is a highly specialized and scalable library dedicated to synchronizing data between local and remote storage, where the local device is intended as the client cloud and the remote one is the cloud server. The library is multipurpose, i.e. it is the same for both client and server systems and its utility is to monitor local and remote files and synchronize changes in real time so as to always have a redundant copy of the data you are working on , on the cloud.
The synchronization library is placed at a higher level than the CommunicationChannel Library and the EncryptedMessaging, and uses the characteristics of the latter to be able to expand with a binary command language, minimalist in data transmission and which therefore allows optimal use of data via the Internet by optimizing the use of bandwidth. EncryptedMessaging also offers a level of encryption and digital identity based on Bitcoin technology, making the communication protocol secure, with a type of encryption transparent to the developer that integrates the commands in the Cloud Sync library. The CommunicationChannel instead works as the underlying at a lower level to manage the TCP socket connection via the internet, theoretically we can replace this library with one specialized in GPRS, or RS425 communication and with relative simplicity we can adapt the Cloud Sync library in scenarios where instead of the internet as a communication channel, we have instead a GSM line or a serial communication or a transmission via modem. Having therefore unpacked the cloud technology into multiple libraries, we can relatively easily adapt a cloud project and different scenarios for which different hardware and technical solutions will be implemented.
The Cloud Sync library is technically an underlying of the CloudBox library and adds to this an efficient and fast data synchronization protocol which takes place by means of a set of commands at the binary level which are transmitted between client and server, to check the synchronization status and proceed with updating the files if necessary. Another task performed by the library is the management of three types of events: Events on the current state of synchronization, events on file transfer, input output events (i.e. events that are triggered upon receipt and sending of communication between client and server), events about file errors, and events that the antivirus system could trigger during the synchronization of presumed infected files. This series of events can launch code that is executed on a possible app with user interface, which uses the library, in order to show the user in real time what is happening during synchronization and inform him of any problems found and on the synchronization progress.
This library also deals with the management of credentials useful for user login (when connecting the client to the server), the management of roles, and provides a class with all the utilities for managing access pins and other things useful for synchronization .
Synchronization takes place through data analysis both on the client side (user) and on the server side (the cloud), and an algorithm optimized for the transmission of the least amount of data between machines, as soon as it is clear what the differences between client and server are, puts in scheduler all the operations to be performed for synchronization, which will be immediately performed, and resumed in the event of an error or drop in the communication line. In any case, if the client should not be online, the synchronization will start automatically as soon as the connection will allow to calculate the differences between client and server and what needs to be updated.
